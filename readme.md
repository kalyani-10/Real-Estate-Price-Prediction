# Real Estate Price Prediction Using Development of "Thinking" Computers

## Introduction

The real estate market in India lacks standardization and transparency, making it difficult for potential buyers to make informed decisions.
This project aims to address this issue by developing a predictive model to estimate real estate prices.

## Technologies Used

*   Python
*   Jupyter Labs
*   Kaggle

## Novelty of Proposed Work

*   Model Comparison: Comprehensive and intricate comparison among 8 different machine learning models.
*   Dataset: Dataset with datapoints based on Indian cities and localities.
*   Comprehensive Dataset: Contains over 40+ column parameters.
*   Cross-Validation & Hyper-Parameter Tuning: Used to enhance accuracy and performance of the machine learning models.

## Conclusion

After testing and validating the 8 machine learning models, it has been observed that XGBoost and Random-Forest models produce the highest results,
with accuracy rates of 78.1517% and 76.5953% respectively. Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Decision Tree models perform moderately well, 
with accuracy ranging between 45-48%.SVM, K-Nearest Neighbour, and Lasso Regression models perform poorly and are not suitable for evaluation.

We believe this project will contribute to better decision making in the real estate market.
